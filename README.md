# CombinatorialBlowUps
If you dont know what
- manifolds with corners
- blow-up
- boundary faces

are, then this code is probably not for you.

##Destricption
This Tool can be used to generate the boundary structure of manifolds with corners, and calculate the boundary structure after the blow-up of a collection arbitrary boundary faces. 

##How to use
Test1 is designed ato Introduce all components of the Tool, including exhaustive commentary.
